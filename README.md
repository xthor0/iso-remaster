# Tooling to build a Rocky Linux or Debian Automated ISO

I have several physical machines that I use as libvirt hosts. And I want to automate ALL. THE. THINGS.

So, I built some tooling to do that.

Just install [podman](https://podman.io/), check out the code, and execute `./run.sh -t debian` (or `rocky`).
